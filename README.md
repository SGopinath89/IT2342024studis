### Setting up Firebase storage
- **Important**: Since firebase storage is used as the default storage setting up this is a must!!.
- **Important**: firebase.js file already contain the most of the data, as I used it to  test the app. Using the file as it is will not provide functionality to this app through my firebase account. It is adviced to set up your own firebase acount. 

1. Log into the https://console.firebase.google.com using the google account.
2. Create a project named Studius(or any prefered name).
3. Select web app from the get started and follow the steps shown in their.
4. Under the installation command there is the firebase SDK.
5. Copy it and paste it in the 'firebase.js' file in following directory : /Client/src/utils/firebase.js .
6. From the file, copy the apikey and pass it's value as 'VITE_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY' in .env file.
7. Then replace the apikey value of the firebase.js file with 'import.meta.env.VITE_APP_FIREBASE_API_KRY' .
8. Next from sidebar click on Build > storage. Then click get started and follow its steps.

    ADMIN_REGNUMBER = registration number for admin
    SUPPORTMAIL = email used to provide support for users (For sending password reset requests. keep-in mind that this email will be used by users, so it's better to make a new mail for just this.)
    SUPPORTAPPPASSWORD = google app password (Note: This is not the acount password. How to obtain this password will be list in the below.)
    MAILSERVICE = mail service you will be using (ex: 'gmail', 'yahoo.mail')
